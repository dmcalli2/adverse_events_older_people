## Hard outcome trials and SAEs

Noticed low rates in trials with hard outcomes. HTerefore reviewed these trials to see whether or not primary outcomes were included or excluded from SAE counts.

"The number of serious adverse events, one of the secondary end
points in this study, was 47 (8.1%) in the high-dose angiotensin II receptor
blocker group and 51 (8.7%) in the angiotensin II receptor blocker+calcium
channel blocker group, with no significant difference between the 2 groups
(P=.75)"
"There were 58 primary events"
Not clear from either the numbers or text whether SAEs excluded or included primary events - UNCLEAR

Appears not to include endpoints. 
"The primary endpoint occurred in 116/2568 patients (4.5%) in the olmesartan plus CCB group, and in 135/2573 patients (5.3%) in the olmesartan plus diuretic group (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.07, P=0.16).
The incidence of SAEs was lower in the olmesartan plus CCB group (211/2568 patients, 8.2%) than in the olmesartan plus diuretic group (253/2573 patients, 9.8%) (= 0.046). The three most frequent SAEs were malignancy (olmesartan plus CCB vs. olmesartan plus diuretic: 2.5 vs. 3.1%; P = 0.17), gastrointestinal disorders
(1.1 vs. 1.1%; P = 0.79), and infection (0.9 vs. 0.9%; P = 0.76)" - EXCLUDED PRIMRY OUTCOMES

#NCT00558428 - "from CTG hard outcome was general oedema. Clearly many more cases of general oedema than there were
# SAEs so I think that these are not included within the SAEs - EXCLUDED PRIMARY OUTCOMES
