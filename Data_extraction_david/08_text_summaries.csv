      dose at the end of a 6 to 8-week treatment period as measured by the 24-hour ABPM mean and to
      demonstrate that MICARDISÂ® is statistically superior to DiovanÂ® in reducing DBP during the
      last 6-hours of the 24-hour dosing interval as measured by ABPM following a dose of active
      study medication at the end of a 6 to 8-week treatment period.

NCT00134160,OlmeSartan and Calcium Antagonists Randomized (OSCAR) Study,The Study Comparing the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events Between High-dose ARB Monotherapy and Combination Therapy With ARB and Calcium Channel Blocker in Japanese Elderly Hypertensive Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk,"
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether high-dose angiotensin II receptor blocker
      (ARB) monotherapy or combination therapy with ARB and calcium channel blockers is more
      effective in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events in Japanese elderly high-risk
      hypertensive patients not adequately controlled by standard dose ARB alone.
    ","
      Hypertension is one of the major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. It is also
      important for elderly hypertensive patients to strictly reduce their blood pressures to
      prevent cardiovascular events. Although angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are
      increasingly used in antihypertensive treatment recently, few studies have been performed in
      Japan to assess the difference between high-dose ARB monotherapy and combination therapy of
      ARB with calcium channel blocker (CCB) in prevention of cardiovascular diseases for patients
      whose blood pressure is not well controlled by ARB monotherapy. OSCAR-study is a multicenter,
      active-controlled, 2-arm parallel group comparison, prospective randomized open blinded
      end-point (PROBE) design study. The dose administered is olmesartan medoxomil 20mg/day as ARB
      monotherapy in the 'Step 1' period. If the blood pressure is not adequately controlled and
      treatment is well tolerated then the dose is changed to olmesartan medoxomil 40mg/day in the
      high-dose ARB monotherapy group, or olmesartan medoxomil 20mg/day and a CCB in the
      combination therapy group in the 'Step 2' period. At least 500 patients will be enrolled in
      each group, and the follow-up duration will be 3 years. The primary objective is to compare
      the incidence of a composite of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, and all cause
      mortality between the two treatment groups.

      To demonstrate that a fixed dose combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg is
      superior to telmisartan 80 mg alone in patients, who fail to respond adequately to
      telmisartan 80 mg monotherapy, in lowering seated trough diastolic blood pressure after eight
      weeks of treatment.
    ","
      This is a multi-centre, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study in
      approximately 244 patients with a history of mild-to-moderate hypertensive who have been
      shown not to respond to telmisartan monotherapy.

      All patients will enter a one-week screening phase prior to starting the eight-week
      open-label T80 mg period. At the end of four weeks, only patients who fail to respond to T80
      mg (DBP >= 90 mm Hg) will continue the treatment with T80 mg for another four weeks. At the
      end of eight weeks, only patients who fail to respond to T80 mg (DBP >= 90 mm Hg) will be
      randomized, double-blind, to receive either T80 mg alone or the fixed dose combination of T80
      mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg for eight weeks. Seated BP will be taken 24 hours post-dose at each
      visit. Labs, ECG, and physical examination will be done at screening, at baseline and at the
      final visit.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The primary objective of the study, showing that fixed dose combination is superior to
      telmisartan 80 mg alone will be tested using the hypotheses given below.

      H0: u T80/H12.5 - uT80 = 0 mm Hg versus H1: uT80/H12.5 - uT80 not equal 0 mm Hg, where
      uT80/H12.5 anduT80 represent the average reduction from baseline (Visit 4) in trough seated
      DBP for the fixed dose combination and telmisartan 80 mg, respectively.

      Testing of the null hypothesis will be performed using a two-sided test of significance at an
      a-level (type-I error rate) of 0.05.

      Comparison(s):

      The primary efficacy endpoint will be the change from baseline in seated DBP 24 hours
      post-dose at the last visit during the double-blind treatment phase. The pre-dose measurement
      on visit 4 will be viewed as the baseline measurement.

      The general aim of this study is to compare telmisartan 80 mg with valsartan 160 mg in
      hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy with adjusted blood pressure
      beyond the target of 130/80 mmHg after one year of treatment.

      The primary objective of this study is to show that telmisartan 80 mg is at least as
      effective (i.e., not inferior) and possibly superior to valsartan 160 mg in reducing 24 hour
      proteinuria after one year of treatment.
    ","
      This is a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, forced titration, multicentre, parallel
      group trial in patients with essential hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 and diabetic
      nephropathy.

      After a 4-6 week Run-in period, patients are randomised to one of the treatment groups and
      receive either Telmisartan 40 - 80 mg or Valsartan 80 - 160 mg. The treatment regimen is a
      forced titration with the lower dose given for 2 weeks and the higher dose given for the rest
      of the treatment period summing up to 52 weeks of treatment. During the treatment period, 8
      visits to the investigator are scheduled in order to control blood pressure, renal function
      parameters and safety. In addition, parameters of endothelial function and oxidative stress
      are measured at baseline, 6 months and after one year of treatment.

      Study Hypothesis:

      Non-inferiority of telmisartan 80 mg compared to valsartan 160 mg will be tested using the
      following set of hypotheses:

      Null Hypothesis:

      The overall mean change from baseline in UPER (24 hour urinary protein excretion rate) for
      telmisartan 80 mg is inferior to that for valsartan 160 mg by 0.5 g/day or more.

      Alternative Hypothesis:

      The overall mean change from baseline in UPER (24 hour urinary protein excretion rate) for
      telmisartan 80 mg is less than 0.5 g/day worse than that for valsartan 160 mg.

      Comparison(s):

      In order to test the non-inferiority hypothesis, analysis of covariance with treatment and
      centre as main effects and baseline as a covariate will be performed. Time-to-event data will
      be analysed using the log-rank test.

      The purpose of this study is to prove the hypothesis that the progression of renal and
      cardiovascular disease is more efficiently prevented when the angiotensin II receptor blocker
      valsartan is added to conventional antihypertensive therapy.
    ","
      It is widely recognized that suppression of the renin-angiotensin system ameliorates
      progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and that CKD is an important risk factor for
      development of cardiovascular disease. However, it has not been fully clarified if
      amelioration of CKD leads to the lower incidence of cardiovascular disease. The purpose of
      this study is to determine whether the angiotensin II receptor antagonist valsartan, in
      combination with conventional antihypertensive therapy, will ameliorate progression of both
      CKD and cardiovascular disease. The primary outcome is courses of renal and cardiac function.
      The secondary outcome is a composite of a doubling of serum creatinine concentration,
      end-stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke,
      hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure or death from
      cardiovascular causes.

      The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate that a fixed dose combination of
      telmisartan 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (T80/H25) is superior in reducing blood
      pressure after eight weeks compared with a fixed dose combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus
      hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (T80/H12.5) in patients who fail to respond to six weeks
      treatment with T80/H12.5.
    ","
      Adult patients with high blood pressure who are currently taking one, two or three blood
      pressure treatments will be asked to take part in the study. It is expected that about 1,600
      patients in seventeen countries will enter the screening part of the study and approximately
      480 of these patients will be allocated to double-blind randomised study treatment. The study
      will last for approximately fifteen weeks. Patients will visit the study doctor five times
      for assessment. After informed consent, patients will start a screening period for four to
      ten days. During the screening period, patients must take their usual blood pressure
      treatment but will stop this by the date of the next visit. If the patient is suitable for
      this study, they will then start run-in treatment period with telmisartan 80 mg plus
      hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (T80/H12.5) taken as a single tablet once per day for
      approximately six weeks.

      At the end of the run-in treatment period, if the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is below 90
      mmHg, the patient will not proceed as their blood pressure is already controlled by
      T80/H12.5. If the DBP is 90 mmHg or greater they will start the randomised study treatment
      period and be randomly allocated to double-blind treatment with either telmisartan 80 mg plus
      hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg(T80/H25) or T80/H12.5 taken as a single tablet once per day for
      eight weeks. They will also receive a placebo tablet (a dummy tablet which contains no active
      ingredient) every day.

      They will visit the clinic four weeks and eight weeks later for assessment of their blood
      pressure and general health. Their participation in the study is complete eight weeks after
      the start of the randomised treatment period.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The trial hypothesis is that the reduction in seated trough DBP (i.e., seated trough DBP at
      the end of the randomised treatment period compared with the seated trough DBP at the start
      of the randomised treatment period) will be greater in the T80/H25 group compared with the
      T80/H12.5 group.

      Comparison(s):

      The efficacy and safety of the two trial treatments (T80/H25 versus T80/H12.5) will be
      compared. Trough blood pressure is the blood pressure 24 hours after the last dose of trial
      medication.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that telmisartan 80 mg (MICARDISÂ®) is

      hours of the 24-hour dosing interval in mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients at the end of
      an 8 and 14-week treatment period, respectively.
    ","
      Secondary objectives will compare telmisartan (80 mg) (MICARDISÂ® and ramipril (5 mg and 10
      mg) on: 1) the reduction in the last 6-hour ABPM mean pulse pressure (PP) relative to dosing,
      2) the reductions in the 24-hour ABPM mean DBP, SBP and PP relative to dosing, 3) reductions
      in ABPM mean DBP, SBP and PP during other periods of the 24-hour dosing interval (i.e.,
      morning, daytime, and nighttime) relative to clock time, 4) change from baseline in systolic
      and diastolic blood pressure load during the 24-hour dosing interval, 5) reductions in the
      mean seated trough DBP and SBP measured using a manual in-clinic cuff sphygmomanometer, 6)
      responder rates as determined by both ABPM and manual in-clinic cuff measurements and 7)
      Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL).

      Study Hypothesis:

      It is hypothesised that the rise of blood pressure (BP) during the last hours of the sleeping
      period is a cause of the high incidence of cardiovascular events in the morning. The purpose
      of the present study is to demonstrate that telmisartan (MICARDISÂ®) is not inferior to
      ramipril in lowering blood pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Blood
      pressure will be assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) as this will allow
      comparison of the full 24-hour effects of both treatments without artefacts (e.g., white-coat
      hypertension) introduced by measurement of blood pressure in the clinic. This will measure
      diastolic blood pressures over the entire 24-hour dosing interval, with primary attention
      focused on the last six hours of the dosing interval.

      NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES In order to test the multiple hypotheses (e.g.,
      non-inferiority and superiority of telmisartan compared to ramipril), multiple dosages (i.e.,
      telmisartan 80mg (MICARDISÂ®) versus ramipril 5mg and ramipril 10mg after 8 and 14 weeks of
      treatment, respectively), and the two endpoints (i.e., reduction in DBP and SBP during the
      last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval) as measured by ABPM, a completely hierarchical,
      closed testing procedure will be used.

      Hierarchical Closed Testing Procedure:

        1. Non-inferiority of telmisartan 80 mg (MICARDISÂ®) compared to ramipril 5 mg at the end of
           the 8 week treatment period in the reduction of DBP during the last 6 hours of the 24
           hour dosing interval; if significant then,

        2. Superiority of telmisartan 80 mg (MICARDISÂ®) compared to ramipril 5 mg at the end of the
           8-week treatment period in the reduction of DBP during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour
           dosing interval; if significant then,

        3. Superiority of telmisartan 80mg (MICARDISÂ®) compared to ramipril 5 mg at the end of the
           8-week treatment period in the reduction of SBP during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour
           dosing interval; if significant then,

        4. Non-inferiority of telmisartan 80mg (MICARDISÂ®) compared to ramipril 10 mg at the end of
           an 14 week treatment period in the reduction of DBP during the last 6 hours of the
           24-hour dosing interval; if significant then,

        5. Superiority of telmisartan 80mg (MICARDISÂ®) compared to ramipril 10 mg at the end of an
           14-week treatment period in the reduction of DBP during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour
           dosing interval; and if significant then,

        6. Superiority of telmisartan 80mg (MICARDISÂ®) compared to ramipril 10mg at the end of an
           14-week treatment period in the reduction of SBP during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour
           dosing interval.

      A difference of 2 mmHg was determined to be the maximum difference between the mean
      reductions in DBP during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval for the two
      treatments which would be considered to have no clinical importance (i.e., the limit for non
      inferiority). Thus non-inferiority of telmisartan compared to ramipril will be tested using
      the following set of hypotheses:

      Null Hypothesis:

      The overall mean reduction from baseline in ABPM mean DBP during the last 6 hours of the
      24-hour dosing interval for telmisartan 80 mg (MICARDISÂ®) is inferior to that for ramipril by
      at least 2 mmHg.

      Alternative Hypothesis: The overall mean reduction from baseline in ABPM mean DBP during the
      last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval for telmisartan 80mg (MICARDISÂ®) is less than 2
      mmHg smaller than that for ramipril.

      These hypotheses can be stated as:

      H0: dT - dR less than or equal to -2 mmHg versus HA: dT - dR > -2 mmHg where dT and dR
      represent the overall mean reduction from baseline in ABPM mean DBP during the last 6 hours
      of the 24-hour dosing interval for telmisartan and ramipril, respectively, adjusted for any
      other factors included in the statistical model.

      If the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between the
      least square means of both treatments (telmisartan - ramipril) lies above -2 mmHg, then it
      will be concluded that telmisartan 80mg (MICARDISÂ®) is at least as effective as ramipril (5mg
      after 8 weeks of treatment or 10mg after 14 weeks of treatment, depending upon the
      comparison) in reducing DBP during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval.

      Superiority of telmisartan (MICARDISÂ®) compared to ramipril will be tested using the
      following set of hypotheses:

      Null Hypothesis:

      The overall mean reduction from baseline in the ABPM mean during the last 6 hours of the
      24-hour dosing interval for telmisartan 80mg (MICARDISÂ®) is less than or equal to that for
      ramipril.

      Alternative Hypothesis: The overall mean reduction from baseline in the ABPM mean during the
      last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval for telmisartan 80mg (MICARDISÂ®) is greater than
      that for ramipril.

      These hypotheses can be stated as:

      H0: dT - dR less than or equal to 0 mmHg versus HA: dT - dR > 0 mmHg where dT and dR
      represent the overall mean reduction from baseline in ABPM mean DBP during the last 6 hours
      of the 24-hour dosing interval for telmisartan and ramipril, respectively, adjusted for any
      other factors included in the statistical model.

      If the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between the
      least square means of both treatments (telmisartan (MICARDISÂ®) - ramipril) is greater than
      zero, then it will be concluded that telmisartan 80mg (MICARDISÂ®) is statistically superior
      to ramipril (5mg after 8 weeks of treatment or 10mg after 14 weeks of treatment, depending
      upon the comparison) in reducing blood pressure (DBP or SBP, depending upon the comparison)
      during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval.

      Comparison(s):

      Reductions in blood pressure during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval as
      measured by ABPM in patients treated with telmisartan (MICARDISÂ®) compared to patients
      treated with ramipril. The primary analysis will consist of a closed testing procedure first
      testing for non-inferiority of telmisartan 80mg (MICARDISÂ®) compared to ramipril 10mg after
      fourteen weeks of treatment in the reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP); if
      significant, testing for superiority of telmisartan 80 mg (MICARDISÂ®) compared to ramipril 10
      mg in the reduction in DBP; if significant, testing for superiority of telmisartan 80 mg
      (MICARDISÂ®) compared to ramipril 10 mg in the reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP); if
      significant, testing for non-inferiority of telmisartan 80 mg (MICARDISÂ®) compared to
      ramipril 5 mg after eight weeks of treatment in the reduction in DBP; if significant, testing
      for superiority of telmisartan 80 mg (MICARDISÂ®) compared to ramipril 5 mg in the reduction
      in DBP; and if significant, testing for superiority of telmisartan 80mg (MICARDISÂ®) compared
      to ramipril 5mg in the reduction in SBP.

      Primary Objective

        -  The main objective of this study is to assess if a two-month regimen of irbesartan in
           patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome without ST segment elevation can
           reduce inflammation markers (ie hsCRP), in comparison to a similar regimen of enalapril.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To compare both regimens on several other biological parameters which have demonstrated
           their relevance and their predictive clinical value (ie BNP, microalbuminuria, troponin
           I â€¦) in this patient population.

        -  To compare on the above parameters the early initiation of treatment versus the
           initiation of treatment at hospital discharge.

      This study will investigate two registered drugs, one for the treatment of high blood
      pressure and one for the treatment of elevated cholesterol. High blood pressure
      (hypertension) is a common medical condition affecting millions of people worldwide. A wide
      variety of effective drug treatments is available to reduce blood pressure. Elevated
      cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) is a common medical condition affecting people worldwide.
      A wide variety of effective drug treatments is available to reduce cholesterol levels.

      Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia often occur together. They are both important risk
      factors for the development of heart and vessel diseases (e.g. heart attack or stroke).
      Current guidelines advise treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol to reduce
      the risk of cardiovascular diseases. This study will test the simultaneous use of a drug to
      reduce blood pressure and a drug to reduce elevated cholesterol. Both drugs are registered
      and are effective. The drug for treatment of high blood pressure is telmisartan Micardis).
      The drug for treatment of elevated cholesterol is simvastatin (Zocor). Since hypertension and
      hypercholesterolemia frequently occur together, the purpose of this study is to investigate
      whether both drugs can be used simultaneously. A low dose and a high dose of these drugs will
      be used. It will be investigated whether each of the drugs is still as effective when given
      together, at the same time of day, with the other drug.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate which combination therapy is more effective in
      reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events in Japanese elderly high-risk hypertensive
      patients: AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist/calcium channel blocker or AT1
      subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist/low dose diuretic.
    ","
      Recently, antihypertensive combination therapies have been recommended by various guidelines
      because of their additive effects. Combination therapies of AT1 subtype angiotensin II
      receptor antagonist and calcium channel blocker or low dose diuretic have shown
      pharmacological benefit. However, reduction of cardiovascular events and safety profile of
      these combination therapies under same level of antihypertensive target have not been
      investigated yet.

      In this study, primary objective is to compare two combination therapies when
      antihypertensive target is 140/90mmHg in elderly hypertensive patients with high
      cardiovascular risk.

(HOT-ACME 1)","
      The epidemic of obesity is associated with a considerable rise in the incidence of the
      metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Insulin resistance plays an
      important role in the pathogenesis of obesity related hypertension. These patients are at
      high risk to suffer from cardiovascular events. However, current guidelines for treatment of
      hypertension do not provide specific recommendation for the pharmacotherapy of obese
      hypertensive patients due to lack of prospective randomized intervention studies in
      non-diabetic obese hypertensive patients.

      Aside from their antihypertensive effects, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) were shown
      to improve insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, metformin is commonly used to treat the obese
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin can also lower body weight and increase insulin
      sensitivity. In a prospective, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel-group study,
      we will evaluate the effects of ARB (telmisartan and candesartan) or amlodipine combination
      with metformin on weight gain, visceral fat, and metabolic parameters in obese hypertensive
      patients without diabetes mellitus compared with obese hypertensives on ARB or amlodipine
      treatment alone. This study will help to develop future comprehensive treatment strategies
      and guidelines for obesity related hypertension.

NCT00591578,Efficacy and Safety Comparison of Azilsartan Medoxomil to Valsartan in Participants With Essential Hypertension,"A Double-Blind, Randomized, Parallel-Group Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of TAK-491 With Valsartan in Subjects With Essential Hypertension","
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of TAK-491 (azilsartan
      medoxomil), once daily (QD), to valsartan in participants with essential hypertension.
    ","
      Hypertension affects approximately 50 million individuals in the United States. As the
      population ages, the prevalence of hypertension will continue to increase if broad and
      effective preventive measures are not implemented. According to the World Health Organization
      (WHO), hypertension is the most common attributable cause of preventable death in developed
      nations, as uncontrolled hypertension greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease,
      cerebrovascular disease, and renal failure. Despite the availability of antihypertensive
      treatments, hypertension remains inadequately controlled; only about one-third of patients
      continue to maintain control successfully.

      This study is being conducted to determine whether administration of azilsartan medoxomil in
      subjects with essential hypertension is more efficacious in reducing systolic blood pressure
      than valsartan.

      Study participation is anticipated to be approximately 7 months. Outside of the study center,
      participants will be required to wear an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device at 24
      hour intervals.

      Following completion of the 6-month double-blind treatment period, all available subjects
      will be offered the option to continue in a 28-week extension study with open-label
      azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg.

      For the extension study, participants will take azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg, tablets, orally,
      once daily for up to 28 weeks. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg or 25 mg or any other
      antihypertensive (except angiotensin II receptor blockers) may be added in a step-wise
      fashion to maintain blood pressure within target <140/90 mmHg for non-diabetic subjects and
      <130/80 mmHg for diabetic subjects

NCT00696241,Efficacy and Safety of Azilsartan Medoxomil in Participants With Essential Hypertension,"A Phase 3, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of TAK-491 in Subjects With Essential Hypertension","
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of azilsartan medoxomil,
      once daily (QD), compared to placebo and olmesartan in participants with essential
      hypertension.
    ","
      Hypertension affects approximately 50 million individuals in the United States. As the
      population ages, the prevalence of hypertension will continue to increase if broad and
      effective preventive measures are not implemented. According to the World Health
      Organization, hypertension is the most common attributable cause of preventable death in
      developed nations, as uncontrolled hypertension greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular
      disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renal failure. Despite the availability of
      antihypertensive treatments, hypertension remains inadequately controlled; only about
      one-third of patients continue to maintain control successfully.

      TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) is an angiotensin II receptor blocker and this study is being
      conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral azilsartan medoxomil compared to
      placebo and olmesartan in subjects with essential hypertension.

      Individuals who want to participate in this study will be required to provide written
      informed consent. Study participation is anticipated to be about 11 weeks. Multiple
      procedures will occur at each visit which may include fasting, blood collection, urine
      collection, vital signs including sitting blood pressure and pulse, body height and weight,
      physical examinations and electrocardiograms. Outside of the study center, participants will
      be required to wear an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device at 24 hour intervals.

      one-third of patients successfully maintain control.

      A major component of blood pressure regulation is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
      This is a system of hormone-mediated feedback interactions that result in the relaxation or
      constriction of blood vessels in response to various stimuli. Angiotensin II, a polypeptide
      hormone, is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting
      enzyme as part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Angiotensin II is the principal
      pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and has multiple effects on the
      cardiovascular system and on electrolyte homeostasis.

      TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) is an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist currently
      being tested as a treatment for essential hypertension.

      Patients having uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension are at risk of experiencing
      cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke. To reduce this risk an
      appropriate antihypertensive therapy should allow to reach a target blood pressure of less
      than 130/80 mmHg in order to maximise cardiovascular protection.The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the efficacy in blood pressure control when anti-hypertensive therapy is
      initiated with a combination of low dose Nifedipine GITS and Telmisartan compared to a
      regimen starting with monotherapy before adding the other drug.The primary efficacy parameter
      will be the 24 hour mean systolic Blood Pressure on Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring

NCT00846365,Efficacy and Safety of Azilsartan Medoxomil Plus Chlorthalidone in Participants With Moderate to Severe Hypertension,"A Phase 3, Double-Blind, Randomized, Efficacy and Safety Study Comparing the TAK-491 Plus Chlorthalidone Fixed-Dose Combination vs Benicar HCTÂ® (Olmesartan Medoxomil-Hydrochlorothiazide) in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Essential Hypertension","
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of azilsartan medoxomil
      combined with chlorthalidone, once daily (QD), in participants with moderate to severe
      essential hypertension.
    ","
      According to the World Health Organization, hypertension is the most common attributable
      cause of preventable death in developed nations, as uncontrolled hypertension greatly
      increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and renal failure. As
      the population ages, the prevalence of hypertension will continue to increase if broad and
      effective preventive measures are not implemented. Despite the availability of
      antihypertensive agents, hypertension remains inadequately controlled; only about one-third
      of patients continue to maintain control successfully.

      Although most antihypertensive agents are effective at the appropriate dose, the majority
      have side effects that limit their use. As a class, angiotensin II receptor blockers
      generally are considered more tolerable than other classes of antihypertensive agents.
      TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) is an angiotensin II receptor blocker being evaluated by
      Takeda to treat essential hypertension.

      Treatments for essential hypertension commonly include use of a thiazide-like diuretic,
      either alone or as part of combination treatment. Although chlorthalidone was commonly
      prescribed in the past, its use has widely been replaced with hydrochlorothiazide, presumably
      due to a lack of available combination products containing chlorthalidone, the assumption
      that hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone have similar antihypertensive effects and
      cardiovascular benefits, and the perception that chlorthalidone use is associated with a
      greater frequency of hypokalemia. However, the frequency of hypokalemia with chlorthalidone
      use is relatively low in the dose range of 12.5 to 25 mg and these doses have been shown to
      be associated with potent blood pressure reduction. Several long-term outcomes trials have
      shown that blood pressure reductions associated with chlorthalidone treatment reduce risk of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

      Most hypertensive patients require two or more agents to achieve target blood pressure and
      diuretics are commonly used in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

      Participants in this study will be randomized to receive one of 3 possible dosing
      combinations of azilsartan medoxomil with either chlorthalidone or olmesartan
      medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide over 8 weeks. The total duration of the study is approximately
      13 weeks. Participants will make a total of 11 visits to the clinic, and will be required to
      participate in a follow-up telephone call 14 days after last dose of the study drug for
      adverse event assessment.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and tolerability of azilsartan medoxomil
      plus chlorthalidone, once daily (QD), versus olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide in
      adults with essential hypertension.
    ","
      High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) is the most common cause of preventable death in developed
      nations. Uncontrolled hypertension greatly increases the risk of heart disease, brain
      disease, and kidney failure. As the population ages, the incidence of hypertension will
      continue to increase if effective preventive measures are not implemented. Despite the
      availability of antihypertensive agents, hypertension is not adequately controlled; only
      about one in three patients successfully keep blood pressure normal.

      Treatment for high blood pressure includes thiazides or thiazide-like diuretics, either alone
      or as part of combination treatment. Chlorthalidone is a commercially available, orally
      administered thiazide-type diuretic agent.

      TAK-491 (azilsartan) is an angiotensin II receptor blocker being evaluated by Takeda to treat
      patients with high blood pressure (essential hypertension).

      This study will compare the safety and tolerability of azilsartan medoxomil plus
      chlorthalidone (TAK-491CLD) fixed-dose combination to olmesartan
      medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide fixed-dose combination.

      Initially patients will undergo a Screening Visit to confirm that they are eligible to
      participate in the study. All participants will receive the study drug for up to 52 weeks.
      The dose of the study drug may be gradually increased throughout the study so that a target
      blood pressure value can be reached for each participant.

      Throughout the treatment period of the study, participants will be required to visit the
      research site for 11 visits. At these study visits participants will be required to undergo
      certain study procedures including physical examinations, vital sign measurements (blood
      pressure, heart rate, weight and height), electrocardiograms (monitoring of the heart), and
      blood and urine samples taken for clinical laboratory tests.

      antihypertensive agents, hypertension remains inadequately controlled; only about one third
      of patients continue to maintain control successfully.

      Treatment algorithms for essential hypertension commonly include thiazides or thiazide-like
      diuretics, either alone or as part of combination treatment. Chlorthalidone is a commercially
      available, orally administered thiazide-type diuretic agent.

      TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) is an angiotensin II receptor blocker developed by Takeda to
      treat participants with essential hypertension.

      This study will compare the safety and tolerability of azilsartan medoxomil plus
      chlorthalidone (TAK-491CLD) fixed-dose combination to olmesartan medoxomil plus
      hydrochlorothiazide fixed-dose combination.

      SevikarÂ® (olmesartan(OM)/amlodipine (AM)) 40/10 mg compared to the combination of Perindopril
      (PER) 8 mg plus Amlodipine 10 mg with regard to central systolic blood pressure lowering
      effect, using the change from baseline (Week 0) to final examination (Week 24).

      Male and female Caucasians aged â‰¥ 40 years and <80 years with moderate to severe
      hypertension, defined by a systolic blood pressure (SBP) â‰¥ 160 and â‰¤ 200 or diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP) â‰¥ 100 and â‰¤ 115 mmHg for untreated patients, SBP â‰¥ 140 or DBP â‰¥ 90 mmHg for
      insufficiently pre-treated patients and SBP â‰¥ 130 mmHg or DBP â‰¥ 80 mmHg for insufficiently
      pretreated diabetics chronic kidney disease will be eligible for participation. In
      addition,three additional risk factors should be present.

      During the course of the study three central blood pressure measurements (at randomization,
      at week 12 and at termination) will be performed with SphygmoCor ultrasound method. The
      conventional measurements with calibrated tensiometers (Omron) will be performed at each
      visit. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will be performed at randomisation.

      The study starts with a 2-4 week run in phase. AM will be given as open-labelled 5 mg or 10
      mg tablets, administered once daily. After randomization during the double-blind phase, study
      medication will comprise either OM/AM 40/10 mg or PER 8 mg (2x4 mg) plus AM 10 mg and will be
      administered once daily. Furthermore, open-label HCTZ 12.5 mg and 25.0 mg will be provided in
      tablets and administered once daily according to the treatment schedule.

      The primary endpoint is the change in central SBP from baseline (Week 0, Visit 0) to final
      examination (Week 24, Visit 5) using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach.

      The study is conducted in approximately 15 centres in Spain. Depending on the previously
      administered drugs the run in phase is up to four weeks (Visits -2 and -1). Individual
      duration of active treatment (after randomization) will last 24 weeks (Visits 0-5). The total
      individual duration is 28 weeks.

      A total of 518 patients (259 patients/arm) will be needed in the Per Protocol Set (PPS) for
      the confirmatory primary analysis using mean change from baseline (Week 0) to Final
      Examination assuming a drop out rate of 20% during Run-in Phase a total of 720 patients have
      to be screened in order to achieve 576 (288 patients/arm) randomised patients.

      Assuming approximately 10% major protocol deviations, a total of 518 patients will remain in
      the PPS.
