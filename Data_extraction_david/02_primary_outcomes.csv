The arm with the higher diastolic BP reading was used for the measurements at all subsequent visits. Blood pressure in the sitting position was measured after resting in a seated position for at least 5 minutes. The measurement was repeated a total of 3 times at intervals of 1 to 2 minutes. A negative number indicates lowered blood pressure."
NCT00413413,Change in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP) From Baseline to End of Study (Week 8),"Blood pressure (BP) was measured with a calibrated aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer. The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position for five minutes, systolic/diastolic BP was measured 3 times at 1-2-minute intervals. The mean of the 3 measurements was calculated."

NCT00219141,Change in Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI) From Baseline to End of Study (Week 36),"Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An increase in LVMI indicates hypertrophy of the left ventricle. This could be a normal reversible response to cardiovascular conditioning (athletic heart) or an abnormal irreversible response to chronically increased volume load (preload) or increased pressure load (afterload). Thickening of the ventricular muscle results in increased left ventricular pressure, increased end-systolic volume, and decreased end-diastolic volume, causing an overall reduction in cardiac output."
