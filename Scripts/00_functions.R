## Can calcualte combined standard deviation of groups as per
## https://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_7/table_7_7_a_formulae_for_combining_groups.htm
## However, and while written code to allow this, it is probably unnecessary
## as these are randomised groups
## instead just assume same SD across groups and pool
## Note comb mean is the same for both
CombMean <- function(n1, m1, n2, m2){
  top <- n1*m1 + n2*m2
  top/(n1+n2)

  top = (n1-1)*s1^2 + (n2-1)*s2^2 + (n1*n2/(n1+n2)) * (m1^2 + m2^2 - 2*m1*m2)
  bottom = n1 + n2 -1
  res = (top/bottom)^0.5
  res

## test this, it is correct
myvects <- map(rep(1, 2), ~ rnorm(10, sample(1:100, .x), sample(5:15, .x)))

##Vectorised and simple pooled means and sds, note that in the mean case it is 
## just a weighted means
